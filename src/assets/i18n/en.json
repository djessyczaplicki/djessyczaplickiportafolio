  "deliicious-description": "This app was made as a group project with 3 classmates. Deliicious allows waiters to place orders with ease from the phone, and with the help of a Rest API, it sends the orders to the kitchen and track their state in real time from ordered to delivered to the table. Deliicious also comes with an ingredients storage management, which detects what ingredients an order needs and substract the quantity they need from the stock, enabling the managers to know when they are short on a product. You can also customise the layout of the tables in the restaurant on the home screen.",
